# Analytics Module: New Relic Browser

This plugin provides an opinionated implementation of the Backstage Analytics API for New Relic Browser. Once installed and configured, analytics events will be sent to New Relic as your users navigate and use your Backstage instance.

This plugin contains no other functionality.

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/analytics-module-nr](http://localhost:3000/analytics-module-nr).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
