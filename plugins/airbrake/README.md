# Airbrake

Welcome to the Airbrake plugin!

_This plugin is currently WIP_

## Getting started

You can serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
