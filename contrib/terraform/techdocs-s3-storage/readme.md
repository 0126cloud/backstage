This Terraform file should build an S3 bucket and configure IAM with a user and an inline policy that grants the user access to the bucket. After you've established the bucket, user, and policy, go to the user's AWS dashboard and generate an access key. This access key should be used to set the environment variables in step 3a [here](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage#configuring-aws-s3-bucket-with-techdocs).
