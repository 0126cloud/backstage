# Confluence

These files help you add Confluence as a source to the Backstage Search plugin.
To do so, add both files in this directory under the packages/backend/src/plugins/search/ pathway in your Backstage app as TypeScript files.
Then, update your packages/app/src/components/search/SearchPage.tsx and packages/backend/src/plugins/search.ts
to include the new Search source.
