AWS S3 authentication in TechDocs has been improved.

1. `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.bucketName` is now the only required config. `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.credentials` and `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.region` are optional.

2. If `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.credentials` and `techdocs.publisher.awsS3.region` are missing, the AWS environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION` will be used. There are more better ways of setting up AWS authentication. Read the guide at https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage
