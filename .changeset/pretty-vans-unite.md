Package roles are now marked as stable and migration is encouraged. Please check out the [migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/package-role-migration).

The new `package`, `repo`, and `migrate` command categories are now marked as stable.

Marked all commands that are being replaced by the new `package` and `repo` commands as deprecated.

The package templates used by the `create` command have all been updated to use package roles.
