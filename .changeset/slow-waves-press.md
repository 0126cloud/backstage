**DEPRECATED**: The `EntityRef` type and `parseEntityName` function are now
deprecated, and will soon be removed. This is part of a larger movement toward
fixing the poorly named `EntityName` type which should instead have been named
`EntityRef`. Please remove any usage of these as soon as possible.
