'@backstage/plugin-azure-devops-backend': patch
---

The `azureDevOps` configuration section is now optional and the `azureDevOps.token` has been deprecated. Use `integrations.azure` instead, see the [Azure DevOps Locations](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/azure/locations) documentation for more details.
