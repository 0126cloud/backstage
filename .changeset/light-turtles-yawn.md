Removed deprecated types that are exported in plugins/catalog-backend/src/ingestion/index.ts. Also fixed deprecated use of "substr" into "substring" in the files plugins/catalog-backend/src/modules/core/PlaceholderProcessor.ts and plugins/catalog-backend/src/service/request/parseEntityFilterParams.ts.
