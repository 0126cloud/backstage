'@backstage/plugin-search': patch
---

Introduces a `<SearchType.Accordion />` variant, which operates on the same part of a search query as the existing `<SearchType />`, but in a more opinionated way (as a single-select control surface suitable for faceted search UIs).

Check the [search plugin storybook](https://backstage.io/storybook/?path=/story/plugins-search-searchtype--accordion) to see how it can be used.
